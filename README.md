ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Lorenc1o, my name is Jose Antonio Lorencio Abril, and I am from CehegÃ­n, Murcia, Spain ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸.
I have recently finished a Double Bachelor's degree in **Mathematics** :1234: and **Computer Science** :computer: at the University of Murcia.

I love the way Mathematics allows us to learn, discover and proof truths that will never change, and how these ideas can in many cases be applied to real world problems, connecting matters that are often seemingly unrelated.

I love how Computer Science help us to implement the maths of the world of ideas into the natural, real world, solving important problems and improving people's life.

In the future, I want to continue this learning path, and the field in which I believe I can contribute the most with my work and ideas is **Data Science**. This is why I applied to the **BDMA: Big Data Management and Analytics**, an Erasmus Mundus Joint Master's Degree coordinated by the ULB (
UniversitÃ© Libre de Bruxelles) and co-financed by the European Commission. In this program I will study:

- One semester at the ULB :belgium:
- One semester at the BarcelonaTech :es:
- I will attend the eBISS (European Business Inteligence and Big Data Summer School)
- One semester at either CentraleSupÃ©lec :fr:, UniPD :it: or Eindhoven University of Technology :netherlands:, depending on the chosen specialty
- Developing of the Master's thesis at one partner institution 

:bulb: What will you find in my github repositories?
- Class notes of several courses
- My Bachelor's theses
- Probably some programs (but probably not many, as if someone copies my course projects I could be in trouble!)
- Some short writings
- Whatever I am up to at the moment :smiley:
